        <p class="empad left">The Kanto region is where the Pokemon games Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Fire Red, and Leaf Green take place. Kanto is home to at least 151 species of Pokemon, starting with Bulbasaur, and ending with Mew. Team Rocket is the local “evil team”, led by Giovanni. After battling the Elite 4, be sure to defeat your rival at the Champion’s throne and claim the title for yourself!</p>

        <p class="empad left h2">Johto Region info</p>
        <p class="empad left">The Johto region is directly west of the Kanto region. New Pokemon trainers in Johto get to pick either Cyndaquil, Totodile, or Chikorita from the Pokemon Professor Elm in New Bark Town. The Team Rocket infestation is a problem in Johto, too. Trainers from the Johto region may visit Kanto once they become Champion of the region. The best Pokemon games, namely Soul Silver and Heart Gold, start you off in the Johto region.</p>

        <p class="empad left">The Hoenn region is the setting for the Pokemon games Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Alpha Sapphire, and Omega Ruby. Professor Birch gives new Hoenn trainers their pick of Treecko, Mudkip, and Torchic as their starter Pokemon. Problematic evil teams in Hoenn include Team Magma, led by the sinister Maxie, and Team Aqua, whose leader is Archie. Make sure to capture Groudon and Kyogre before they do!</p>

        <p class="empad left h2">Sinnoh Region info</p>
        <p class="empad left">The Sinnoh region is where the Pokemon games Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, and their remakes Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl take place. Pokemon trainers may choose from Turtwig, Piplup, or Chimchar in these main-series games. Legends say that the Sinnoh region was created by the Legendary Pokemon Arceus, which explains another game: Legends-Arceus, about the early, Feudal Japan-esque days of Sinnoh. There, you may pick from Cyndaquil, Rowlet, or Oshawott. Team Galactic is the local “evil team”.

        <p class="empad left h2">Unova Region info</p>
        <p class="empad left">Unova houses legends of two distinct Dragon type Pokemon: the black Electric type Zekrom, and the white Fire type Reshiram. In the games Pokemon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2, you may choose from the starter Pokemon Snivy, Tepig, and Oshawott. Team Plasma is the local “evil team”, though they are a bit more complicated than they first appear. In the vivid post-game of Pokemon White 2, enjoy defending your title as the Most Powerful Pokemon Trainer in the region by taking on unusually strong trainers in the Battle Tree, seeing rare and even some Legendary Pokemon along the way!

        <section>
        <p class="empad left h2">Kalos Region info</p>
        <p class="empad left">Viva la Kalos! This sparkling region is inspired strongly by France, with poodles, palaces, huge towers and Mega Evolution to boot! The main series Pokemon games X and Y take place in Kalos, and trainers get to choose from Chespin, Froakie, or the much more betterer fire fox, Fennekin. Team Flare is the “evil team” here, led by Lysandre. The box art Legendary Pokemon are the majestic forest spirit stag with crystalline antlers, Xerneas, and the blood-red and deep grey death god bird, Yveltal.</p>

        <section>
        <p class="empad left h2">Alola Region info</p>
        <p class="empad left">Alola is based upon Hawaii. A bit odd, since Unova was based upon America. Perhaps Alola is governed by Unova, which could explain why it doesn’t at first have its own Pokemon League in the games Sun and Moon. Professor Kukui offers new trainers the choice of starters Litten, Popplio, and Rowlet, but the region has plenty of Eevees. I mean cool Pokemon from other regions available to catch. Most of the Pokemon introduced here are not so typical, could have something to do with the Ultra Beasts looking nothing like Kantonese Pokemon. If you like main series Pokemon games, don’t play Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. Too many cut scenes and unnecessary side quests.</p>
